    "What is a Python library?\n",
    " * A Python library is essentially a collection of pre-written code, including modules and packages, that provides specific functionalities.\n",
    " * Think of it as a toolkit containing ready-to-use tools that you can incorporate into your Python programs.\n",
    " * These libraries save developers from having to write code from scratch for common tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use Python libraries?\n",
    " * Code Reusability:\n",
    "   * Libraries allow you to reuse existing code, which saves time and effort. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can simply import and use the functions and classes provided by a library.\n",
    " * Increased Efficiency:\n",
    "   * Libraries provide optimized and tested code, which can improve the efficiency and performance of your programs.\n",
    " * Expanded Functionality:\n",
    "   * Python libraries offer a vast range of functionalities, from basic tasks like file manipulation to advanced tasks like machine learning and data visualization.\n",
    " * Simplified Development:\n",
    "   * Libraries simplify the development process by providing high-level abstractions and tools that make it easier to solve complex problems.\n",
    " * Community Support:\n",
    "   * Python has a very large and active community, which means there are a huge number of high quality libraries available.\n",
    " * Specialized Tasks:\n",
    "   * Libraries allow programmers to easily carry out specialized tasks. For example, in data science, libraries like Pandas and NumPy are essential for data manipulation and analysis."

    "Python Lists:\n",
    " * Flexibility:\n",
    "   * Lists are incredibly versatile. They can hold elements of various data types within the same list (e.g., integers, strings, other lists).\n",
    "   * They are dynamic, meaning their size can change easily. You can add or remove elements as needed.\n",
    " * General-Purpose:\n",
    "   * Lists are a fundamental part of Python and are used for a wide range of general-purpose programming tasks.\n",
    " * Performance:\n",
    "   * For numerical computations, especially with large datasets, lists can be relatively slow.\n",

    "   * NumPy arrays are designed to hold elements of the same data type. This homogeneity is crucial for efficient numerical operations.\n",
    " * Numerical Computing:\n",
    "   * NumPy arrays are optimized for numerical computations. They provide powerful mathematical functions and operations.\n",
    "   * They support \"vectorized\" operations, which means you can perform operations on entire arrays at once, significantly speeding up computations.\n",
    " * Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "   * Due to their homogeneous nature and contiguous memory allocation, NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient than lists, especially for large datasets.\n",
    " * Performance:\n",
    "   * NumPy arrays are significantly faster than lists for numerical operations."

    "2. Finding the Inverse of a Transformation:\n",
    " * In linear algebra, matrices can represent linear transformations. The inverse of a matrix represents the inverse transformation. If you have a transformation matrix, finding its inverse allows you to reverse the transformation.\n",
