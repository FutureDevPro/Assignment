    "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle involving three rods (let's call them A, B, and C) and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n",
    "The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n",
    " * Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    " * Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n",

    "Explanation\n",
    " * Base Case:\n",
    "   * The function first checks if n (the number of disks) is 1. If it is, it means we only have one disk to move. We simply move it from the source rod to the destination rod and print the move. This is the base case that stops the recursion.\n",
    " * Recursive Steps:\n",
    "   * If n is greater than 1, we break the problem into three smaller subproblems:\n",
    "     * Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary:\n",
    "       * We recursively call the tower_of_hanoi function to move the top n-1 disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod, using the destination rod as the temporary auxiliary rod.\n",
    "     * Move the nth disk from source to destination:\n",
    "       * After moving the n-1 disks to the auxiliary rod, we move the largest disk (the nth disk) from the source rod to the destination rod.\n",
    "     * Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination:\n",
    "       * Finally, we recursively call the tower_of_hanoi function again to move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod, using the source rod as the temporary auxiliary rod. "

    "How Recursion Works\n",
    " * Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    " * In the Tower of Hanoi, we break down the problem of moving n disks into smaller problems of moving n-1 disks.\n",
    " * The base case (n == 1) ensures that the recursion eventually stops.\n",
    " * Each recursive call works on a smaller subproblem, and the results are combined to solve the original problem.\n",
    "How Movements Are Accomplished\n",
    " * The movements of disks are accomplished through the print statements within the recursive function.\n",
    " * Each print statement indicates a single move, specifying the disk number and the rods involved.\n",
    " * The order of the recursive calls and the print statements ensures that the moves are performed according to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.\n"
